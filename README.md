## Introduction

Golang, also known as Go, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. My journey began with Python, where I enjoyed building web applications and backend services. As I explored Golang, I found its performance and concurrency features appealing. This repository documents my learning process, including tutorials, code snippets, and projects that I have created.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers various topics related to Golang and backend development, including:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Education resources
- Fiber framework
- gRPC
- Kafka
- Microservices
- Web applications

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes various technologies to enhance its functionality:

### Docker & Docker Compose

Docker allows you to package applications into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments. Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications.

### Fiber

Fiber is a web framework built on top of Go. It is designed for speed and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for building web applications.

### gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that uses HTTP/2. It enables efficient communication between services, making it ideal for microservices architectures.

### Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

### Microservices

Microservices architecture allows you to develop applications as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. This approach enhances scalability and maintainability.
